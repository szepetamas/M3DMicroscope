## Requirements

Micro+ 3D printer (or equivalent)
1600x USB microscope (or similar)
3D printed parts (https://github.com/szepetamas/M3DMicroscope/tree/master/STLFiles)
srews
tools for assembly

## Configurations

The project currently supports two main configurations
1.) 1 port plate scanner with tha main bracket

2.) 4 port slide scanner with the slider bracket

## Assembly instructions for 3D printable parts

1.) Print the parts you need with your fafourite slicer software

2.) Replace the door unit of the printer head

3.) Mount the microscope holder onto the door unit

4.) Mount the main bracket with the bracket holders onto the top of the 3D printer

5.) In the M3DExpert software (came with the printer) move the head in X and Y directions, and focus with directions in Z axis

## Optional assembly instructions (requires a little more basic tech skills!)

The original printer cable can be rerouted under the top frame section of the 3D printer. In order to do that, you have to disassemble the pritner base, and also cut off the outer shell of the cable in order to make it more flexible.

Also note that, based on the current design additional USB microscopes can be designed and fitted onto the printer head.
